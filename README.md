### CHAPTER 2

##### 07/06/2025

Typo encountered in the last question. The line for the first fragment should be:

    my_dna[0:63]

This makes the correct answer looks like **0.782**

### CHAPTER 7

##### 09/08/2025

The answer is wrong for the 5th criteria of the first question.

When finding accession names containing both the letter d and e in any order, the correct answer should be:

**[' eihd39d9', ' chdsye847', ' hedle3455', ' xjhd53e', ' de37dp']**

However, the answer given by the text book is: **hedle3455 de37dp**, which is obviouslly missing something.
